# An Analysis on London Bike Sharing
##  Explaining excess rentals in TFL

```{r, get_tfl_data, cache=TRUE}
url <- "https://data.london.gov.uk/download/number-bicycle-hires/ac29363e-e0cb-47cc-a97a-e216d900a6b0/tfl-daily-cycle-hires.xlsx"
# Download TFL data to temporary file
httr::GET(url, write_disk(bike.temp <- tempfile(fileext = ".xlsx")))
# Use read_excel to read it as dataframe
bike0 <- read_excel(bike.temp,
                   sheet = "Data",
                   range = cell_cols("A:B"))
# change dates to get year, month, and week
bike <- bike0 %>% 
  clean_names() %>% 
  rename (bikes_hired = number_of_bicycle_hires) %>% 
  mutate (year = year(day),
          month = lubridate::month(day, label = TRUE),
          week = isoweek(day))
```

We can easily create a facet grid that plots bikes hired by month and year.

For May and Jun 2020 we observe that the curves are more flat compared to the previous years. This can be explained by Covid. Also it shows that bike rentals in May and June 2020 are distributed evenly between 20k and 60k, while in the previous years you always have a peak that shows that in the previous years we had for each month a certain number for daily rentals that didn't differ that much by day.

The second one looks at percentage changes from the expected level of weekly rentals. The two grey shaded rectangles correspond to the second (weeks 14-26) and fourth (weeks 40-52) quarters.

```{r tfl_calc, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%", fig.width=10, fig.height=7}
#Since data is on daily basis, find average by month in each year, that's actual rentals
bikes_m <- bike %>%
                  filter(year %in% c(2015: 2020)) %>%
                  group_by(year, month) %>%
                  summarise(actual_rentals=mean(bikes_hired))
#Find average by each month across all years- that's expected rentals
bikes_average <- bikes_m %>%
                  filter(year %in% c(2015: 2019)) %>%
                  group_by(month) %>%
                  summarise(expected_rentals=mean(actual_rentals))
#Merge data
bikes_m <-left_join(bikes_m,bikes_average, by="month")
#Calculate excess rentals
bikes_monthly <- bikes_m %>%
  mutate(excess_rentals = actual_rentals-expected_rentals)
# Months to numeric
bikes_monthly$month <- as.numeric(bikes_monthly$month) 
```

Plot the first Graph, where the blue line is the expected number of rentals in that month, and the black line is actual number of rentals. The difference is shaded red, if number of excess rentals is smaller than 0, and green otherwise.
```{r}
bikes_monthly$month <- as.factor(bikes_monthly$month)
